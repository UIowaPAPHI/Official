        The Pi Chapter of Pi Alpha Phi was colonized on September 10, 2011 and chartered on November
        17, 2012.
        The seven great men, Hakim Tatah, Anthony Dang, Yile Wu, Watson Feng, Brayden Zhao, Tony
        Tran, and John Hartnett,
        who founded the group strived to create a place where individuals could feel at home with
        the people
        they surrounded themselves with.

        They created this chapter with a focus on helping not only Asian males but
        anyone who believed in becoming culturally aware of the campus around them. These founders
        put an emphasis on
        the national pillars and morals of achieving Academic Excellence, Asian American Awareness,
        Leadership,
        Philanthropy, and Brotherhood.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today the Pi Chapter of Pi Alpha Phi Fraternity Inc. is home to a brotherhood that works
        with student
        organizations around campus to make the University of Iowa feel like a home to anyone who
        needs it.
        We encourages one another to succeed, give back to the community, and show everyone what it
        means to be a gentleman
        of Pi Alpha Phi.
